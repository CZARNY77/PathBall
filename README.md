# PathBall :soccer:
Hello :wave:<br>
I created a game in UE5 for mobile platforms, with a though playing together with others.<br>
This game is my first even playable project.
The project is not finished, you can add a lot of things to it, but I want to deal with other projects that are on my mind.:satisfied:

## Game mechanic
The mechanics of the game is to move the ball along the paths. The goal of the game is to push the ball into the opponent's goal.<br>

You may only push the ball once after each path.<br>
